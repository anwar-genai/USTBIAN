# 🔧 PDF Upload Fix

## Issue
The PDF parser wasn't working due to incorrect import syntax.

**Error:**
```
TypeError: pdfParse is not a function
```

## ✅ Fix Applied

### Changed:
```typescript
// Before (Not Working)
const pdfParse = require('pdf-parse');
const data = await pdfParse(buffer);

// After (Working!)
const pdf = require('pdf-parse');
const data = await pdf(buffer);
```

### Files Updated:
1. `backend/src/career/services/resume-parser.service.ts` - Fixed import
2. `web/src/app/career/page.tsx` - Better error messages

## 🧪 Test Now!

### Step 1: Wait for Backend to Start
Give it **10-15 seconds** for the backend to fully restart.

Check backend console for:
```
[Nest] Application successfully started
```

### Step 2: Refresh Your Browser
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` (hard refresh)
- Or close and reopen the tab

### Step 3: Test Upload
1. Go to `/career`
2. Upload a **test PDF resume**
3. Should now work! ✅

## 📄 Test Files

### Good Test Files:
- ✅ Text-based PDF resumes
- ✅ Word documents (.docx)
- ✅ Files under 5MB
- ✅ Standard resume formats

### Won't Work:
- ❌ Scanned PDFs (images, not text)
- ❌ Password-protected PDFs
- ❌ Corrupted files
- ❌ Files over 5MB

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Upload PDF:
```
1. Click or drag PDF file
   ↓
2. Shows "Analyzing Your Resume..." (spinner)
   ↓
3. Backend extracts text from PDF
   ↓
4. AI parses the text into structured data
   ↓
5. Redirects to review page
   ↓
6. Shows extracted resume info
   ↓
7. Click "Get ATS Score"
   ↓
8. Shows score and suggestions
```

### Total Time: ~5-10 seconds

## 🐛 If Still Not Working

### Check Backend Logs:
Look for:
- ✅ `[ResumeParserService] Extracting text from PDF...`
- ✅ `[ResumeParserService] Extracted XXX characters from PDF`
- ✅ `[AIService] Parsing uploaded resume with AI...`

### Common Issues:

**1. Still Getting Error?**
```powershell
# Restart backend manually
cd D:\Projects\Ustbian\backend
Get-Process -Name node | Stop-Process -Force
npm run start:dev
```

**2. Different Error?**
- Check if PDF is text-based (not scanned image)
- Try a different PDF
- Try a DOCX instead

**3. AI Parsing Fails?**
- Check OpenAI API key is set
- Check API key has credits
- Check internet connection

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Use recent resumes** (2020+)
2. **Standard format** (not creative designs)
3. **Text-based PDFs** (not scanned)
4. **Clean formatting** (no fancy graphics)

### File Recommendations:
- **Best**: PDF exported from Word/Google Docs
- **Good**: DOCX from Word/Google Docs
- **Avoid**: Scanned PDFs, image-based resumes

## 🎨 Better Error Messages

The frontend now shows helpful error messages:

### PDF Error:
```
"There was an issue reading your PDF file. 
Please make sure it's a valid, text-based PDF 
(not a scanned image)."
```

### DOCX Error:
```
"There was an issue reading your Word document. 
Please ensure it's a valid .docx file."
```

### Generic Error:
```
"Failed to upload resume. Please check your file 
and try again. Supported formats: PDF, DOCX"
```

## 📊 Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Backend Running:
```powershell
Get-Process -Name node
# Should show running Node processes
```

### 2. Check Backend Logs:
When you upload, watch the backend console for:
- Upload received
- Text extraction started
- Characters extracted
- AI parsing started
- Parsing completed

### 3. Check Browser Console:
Press F12 → Console tab
Look for:
- Upload request sent
- Response received
- Any JavaScript errors

### 4. Check Network Tab:
F12 → Network tab
- Look for POST to `/career/resumes/upload`
- Check status code (should be 200 or 201)
- Check response body

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. ✅ No more "pdfParse is not a function" error
2. ✅ Upload shows loading spinner
3. ✅ Redirects to review page
4. ✅ Shows extracted resume info
5. ✅ Can get ATS score
6. ✅ Can save resume

## 🚀 You're All Set!

The fix is applied and backend is restarting. 

**Give it 15 seconds, refresh your browser, and try uploading again!**

If you still have issues, share:
1. The exact error message
