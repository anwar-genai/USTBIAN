# ✅ All Issues Fixed!

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Fix:**
- Enhanced AI prompt to be more thorough

- Added explicit instructions to extract ALL projects (personal, work, academic)
- Updated return type to include `projects` field

**File:** `backend/src/ai/ai.service.ts`

**Problem:** All PDFs looked the same regardless of template selection

**Fix:**
- Fixed accent color application in PDF generator
- Added explicit color setting for each section

**Files:** `web/src/utils/pdfGenerator.ts`

- ⚪ Minimal: Black (#000000)
- 🟣 Creative: Purple (#8B5CF6)

### Issue 3: Wrong Section Order in PDF

**Before:**
```

```

Look at extracted data in browser console:
```
Parsed data keys: [...should include 'projects']
```

### If PDF Colors Not Changing:

Check browser console when downloading:
```
Template: modern → Color: #3B82F6
Generating PDF with template: modern, color: #3B82F6
Header color RGB: 59, 130, 246
```

Should see different RGB values for each template:
- Modern: 59, 130, 246 (Blue)
- Professional: 31, 41, 55 (Dark Gray)
- Minimal: 0, 0, 0 (Black)
- Creative: 139, 92, 246 (Purple)

### If Section Order Wrong:

Check PDF generation console:
```
Generating PDF with template: modern, color: #3B82F6

Sections should appear in this order in the PDF:
1. Header (Name + Contact)

3. Skills
