# Debug PDF Upload Issue

## We've Added Debug Logging! üîç

I've enhanced the logging to see exactly what's happening when you upload your Chrome PDF.

## Steps to Debug

### 1. Restart Your Backend

Stop your current backend (Ctrl+C) and restart it:

```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```

### 2. Upload Your PDF Again

Go to the Career page and try uploading your Chrome PDF again.

### 3. Check Backend Console Logs

Look at your backend terminal. You should see detailed logs like:

```
=== Resume Upload Debug ===
File name: resume.pdf
File size: 12345 bytes
File type: application/pdf
Buffer size: 12345 bytes
Step 1: Extracting text from file...
[ResumeParserService] Extracting text from PDF...
[ResumeParserService] PDF buffer size: 12345 bytes
[ResumeParserService] PDF parsed successfully
[ResumeParserService] PDF info: 1 pages, ...
[ResumeParserService] Extracted 500 characters from PDF
[ResumeParserService] First 100 chars: ...
Step 2: Text extracted successfully
Extracted text length: 500
First 200 chars: ...
Step 3: Parsing with AI...
```

### 4. Share the Logs

**Copy and paste ALL the logs** from your backend console, especially:

- The `=== Resume Upload Debug ===` section
- The `[ResumeParserService]` logs
- Any ERROR messages

## What We're Looking For

The logs will tell us:

1. ‚úÖ Is the file being received? (File size, type)
2. ‚úÖ Is the PDF being parsed? (PDF info, pages)
3. ‚ùå **Where exactly does it fail?**
   - Step 1: PDF extraction failed?
   - Step 2: No text extracted?
   - Step 3: AI parsing failed?

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario A: PDF Extracts 0 Characters
```
[ResumeParserService] Extracted 0 characters from PDF
[ResumeParserService] PDF was parsed but no text was extracted
```
**This means**: Your PDF is likely image-based (scanned) or has security restrictions.

**Solution**: 
- Try a different PDF
- Re-save your resume as PDF from Word/Google Docs
- Make sure you can select text in the PDF (try opening it and selecting text)

### Scenario B: PDF Parse Fails
```
[ResumeParserService] Error extracting PDF: ...
```
**This means**: The `pdf-parse` library couldn't read the PDF structure.

**Solution**:
- The PDF might be corrupted
- Try re-generating the PDF
- Try a different PDF library (I can help with this)

### Scenario C: AI Parsing Fails
```
Step 3: Parsing with AI...
[AIService] Error parsing resume: ...
```
**This means**: OpenAI API had an issue.

**Solution**:
- Check your OpenAI API key is valid
- Check OpenAI API status: https://status.openai.com/

## Quick Test PDFs

Try these to isolate the issue:

1. **Create a simple test PDF**:
   - Open Notepad or Word
   - Type: "John Doe, Software Engineer, john@example.com"
   - Print to PDF (or Save as PDF)
   - Try uploading this simple PDF

2. **If the simple PDF works**:
   - Your Chrome PDF might have special formatting
   - Try re-generating your resume PDF

3. **If the simple PDF fails too**:
   - There's an issue with the PDF library
   - Share the logs and I'll investigate

## Alternative: Try a DOCX File

If PDFs keep failing, try a Word document (.docx):

1. Save your resume as `.docx`
2. Upload it
3. The backend supports DOCX files too

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Restart backend
2. ‚úÖ Upload PDF
3. ‚úÖ Copy ALL backend logs
4. ‚úÖ Share them with me

I'll then know exactly what's wrong and can fix it! üîß
