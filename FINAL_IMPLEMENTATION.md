## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After restarting, verify:

### Data Extraction:
- [ ] Upload Anwar-resume.docx
- [ ] Check browser console: "Parsed data keys: [...]"
- [ ] Should include: 'projects', 'skills' (with all items)
- [ ] Backend logs show: "Step 4: AI parsing successful"

### PDF Templates:
- [ ] Download Modern PDF → Open → See BLUE
- [ ] Download Professional PDF → Open → See DARK GRAY
- [ ] Download Minimal PDF → Open → See BLACK
- [ ] Download Creative PDF → Open → See PURPLE
- [ ] Each PDF has different colored name and section titles

### PDF Section Order:
- [ ] Open any PDF
- [ ] Check order: Summary → Skills → Projects → Education → Experience
- [ ] Skills section appears BEFORE projects
- [ ] Experience appears AFTER education

### Browser Console Logs (When Downloading):
```
Template: modern → Color: #3B82F6
Generating PDF with template: modern, color: #3B82F6
Header color RGB: 59, 130, 246
```

## 💡 Why This Works Now

### Data Extraction:
**Before:**
```
Extract skills and projects...
```

**After:**
```
Extract ALL technical and soft skills mentioned - be comprehensive!
Extract ALL projects (personal, work, academic)
```

The AI prompt is now more explicit and thorough!

### PDF Templates:
**Before:**
```typescript
// Color set once in constructor
this.accentColor = this.getAccentColor(template);

// Never changed when generating
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Color updated when generating
this.accentColor = this.getAccentColor(template);

// Re-applied for each section
const [r, g, b] = this.hexToRGB(this.accentColor);
this.doc.setTextColor(r, g, b);
```

### Section Order:
**Changed:**
```typescript
// Before
this.addSummary();
this.addExperience();    // ← Wrong order
this.addEducation();
this.addSkills();
this.addProjects();

// After
this.addSummary();
this.addSkills();        // ← Correct order!
this.addProjects();
this.addEducation();
this.addExperience();
```
